## Usage

### Immediate Use (no installation)

### Use within a Web Site (pre built files)



> NOTE: You might need configuration changes to allow access to the some of the contents (examples etc).

#### Use of proxies for remote file loading:

If you want the capability, just like the official www.openjscad.xyz site, to load remote projects/files directly
from the web based user interface, but without the hassle with CORS issues,
then you can use a proxy file (see [remote.pl](./remote.pl) & [remote.php](./remote.php)):

This is a server side script that does the following
- caches the remote file locally on the server
- returns the local path to the downloaded file for local use by the web UI

use and path of the proxy can be set by:
- changing the `proxyUrl` value in [src/ui/index.js](src/ui/index.js)
- since this is hardcoded , if you do not use the provided dev server,
 rebuild your main file (See [Contributing](#contributing))

then you can use it like so:
